        <h4>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h4>

        <div class="ulli">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1933 </strong>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the
              University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known
              as the "National Youth Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1935 </strong>- Has to stop school and save up more money.
              Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
              Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this
              left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the
              US Forestry Service
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1989 </strong>- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
              Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
              Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
              about breeding pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1941 </strong>- Tries to enroll in the military after the
              Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
              his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
              disinfectants, and other applied science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1942 </strong>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
              Pathology
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1983 </strong>- helps seven African countries dramatically
              increase their maize and sorghum yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas
              A&M University
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> 1990 </strong>- states "we will have to double the world
              food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are
              the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
              Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've
              been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.
              Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best
              breeds."
            </li>
            <li><strong>2009 </strong>- dies at the age of 95.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
              contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
              scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
